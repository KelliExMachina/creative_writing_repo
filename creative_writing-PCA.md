# PCA

Simplifies your linear regression model.  Makes it more generalized, often at the expense of model accuracy.  This could possibly make the model more accurate at predictions on new data.  

- Use to reduce the number of components in a model.  
- Easy to compair and decrease multicolinearity.  
- Develop models with less variance.
