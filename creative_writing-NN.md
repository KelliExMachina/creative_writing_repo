# Neural Networks

Model using neurons and layers (input, hidden, and output) to model data.  You must have one input neuro for each input that you will have.  In the hidden layers, you will have neurons for each of your features.  There must be (N-1) output neurons for each of your possible values for the target variable.  The more layers you have, the more accurate the model.  Thats because weights, bias, and an activation function are applied at each layer.  It's called a neural network because it looks like a neuron in your brain.  

To build your network you can use a front-end API like keras, or you can go old-school and use Tensorflow (which keras using on the backend).  There are numerous ways to train and optimize neural networks.  I mostly payed attention to the features that benefit image classification.  For image classification, you would prefer to use Convoluted Neural Networks for image classification.  You would also implement Softmax as the activation function, if you are using a multi-class variable (my capstone will have six).  

I took a lot of notes on the subject!
