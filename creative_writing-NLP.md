# Creative Writing - NLP  

Today I learned how to grab a large text document from a web resource (open source books) and process that data with vectors using nltk.   The NL toolkit allows us to 'tokenize' the words in a text or group of texts, so that we can process (split, count, model) to guage for many things, including sentiment, subject matter, etc.  Now I'm going to use this file as an example in my Jupyter notebook.
